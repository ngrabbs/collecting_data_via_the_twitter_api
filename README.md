Details

I want to find the overlap between the followers of a given twitter account and 20 other twitter accounts (some of them with millions of followers). 

In order to complete this task, you will need to:
1. Write a python script collecting the followers of all the Twitter accounts I will list.
2. Store the data in a MySQL database.
3. Run quires to find the overlap in the followers of the different accounts.
