There is a theory that you can only pull 15 api requests every 15 minutes...
what if you setup multiple apps and get multiple login tokens, is this a way around ?

there is a max rate limit it looks like this:
ngrabbs@jobsbox:~/collecting_data_via_the_twitter_api$ cat YourAnonNews_5| python -mjson.tool|more
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "code": 88,
            "message": "Rate limit exceeded"
        }
    ]
}



next thing we need to build a dict/array that houses all the users we want to search
and for testing do something simple like
pull 200 from each

then we need to pump them into a database
and start to run outputs against them

i think it should have a report that says:
all these users are in all followers
then walk down through the next highest amount
